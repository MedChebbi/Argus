# Argus is an opensource general-purpose robot project

---

## Description

Argus is a dream of an **extensible** robotics platform built on ROS with the main focus being the ease of future integrability of any desired functionality such as:

- Computer Vision: Object detection and tracking, 3D perception, Visual odometry, ...

- Navigation: Autonomous navigation, SLAM, Mapping, ...

- Objects manipulation through a robotic arm (will be built on)

- Teleoperability: Keyboards, controllers, Assisted steering and handling.

### Key Words

- ROS: Robot Operating System

- Python, C/C++

- Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, Jetson Nano

- Robotic Arm, Gripper, Kinematics
